# i3conf-tools

As now this tool is in alpha version, you can only use all of this tools below

> 1. **Remove i3wm title bar**
> 2. **Gaps configuration**
> 3. **Load default config**

## :clap: FYI

For the first time you use this tool, it will make a backup of your current config, so dont worry to restore if your custom config is crashed

## :exclamation: Warning

Also, dont edit the **VARIABLES** file, because any value in this tool is belong to that file, even line changed can cause many error

## :cyclone: Dependency

This tool only required `python3` as it's dependency

## :gear: How to use

Just execute this command

```bash
./i3conf
```

## :gift: Continuation

I will always update this tool in my free time, so it can provide more tools to help you configure your i3wm workspace
